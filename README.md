## Overview for Snake Game

Note: Unfortunately these files do not match the finish product of the game uploaded to surge, I am currently working on finding the final set of files and/or recoding it myself. Please be patient.

The game can be played at  http://snake-game_final.surge.sh/ and it is probably best played on chrome with the audio turned on. 

### Rules for the Snake Game
- Use the arrow keys to move the snake around the board
- Avoid hitting the walls, or your own tail, which will end the game and send you to an end screen
- The more you collect, the more difficult the game becomes!

All of the files that end in .png are image files that are used in the game, I'm sorry for the mess of the repository, we should have probably popped all of the image files into one folder and then called them from said folder.

The following files are in relation the the main page, where you recieve your instructions and rules on how to play the game:
- The html file is snake-game/index.html
